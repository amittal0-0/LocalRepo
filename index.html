Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, perception, and even exhibiting creativity. AI systems can be categorized into two main types:

Narrow AI (Weak AI): Designed to perform a narrow task (e.g., facial recognition, internet searches, or self-driving cars). These systems are highly specialized and operate under a limited set of constraints.

General AI (Strong AI): A theoretical form of AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence. This type of AI does not yet exist.

AI techniques include machine learning, where systems learn from data; neural networks, which are inspired by the human brain's structure; and deep learning, a subset of machine learning with complex neural networks.
